# Hiring Process Analytics
Working as a Data Analyst in Google, I have to extract useful insights from the dataset provided. These insights will depict how the applicants are hired in the company based on the number of candidates hired, the type of candidates, positions open, salaries offered, etc. Based on the past data, improvements can be made by the company to hire better employees suited as per their requirement.

**Tech-Stack Used:**
To implement this project, I have used Microsoft Excel 365 Version 2302.
