# IMDB Movie Analysis
With the dataset provided for IMDB ratings, my job is to analyze it and provide insights that can predict the success of the upcoming movies. In the later pages of this report, I will apply statistical measures on the data which will help movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

**Tech-Stack Used:**
To implement this project, I have used Microsoft Excel 365 Version 2302.
