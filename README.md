# Bank Loan Case Study
With the dataset provided for bank loan data, my job is to analyze it and provide insights that can help save valuable clients for the bank in question while also making sure that it does not lose any money because of defaulters. In the later pages of this report, I will apply statistical measures on the data which will help the bank understand what factors affect the payment probability of a loan applicant. 

**Tech-Stack Used:**
To implement this project, I have used Microsoft Excel 365 Version 2302.
