# Impact of Car Features
With the dataset provided for car features, my job is to analyze it and provide insights that can help the car manufacturers regulate the prices for maximum profits while also ensuring that consumer demands are met. In the later pages of this report, I will apply regression analysis and market segmentation on the data which will help the car manufacturers understand what car features and categories are the most popular among the customers using which they can set their prices. 

**Tech-Stack Used:**
To implement this project, I have used Microsoft Excel 365 Version 2302.
