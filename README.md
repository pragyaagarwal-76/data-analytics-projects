# Instagram User Analytics
Working as a Data Analyst in Meta for the Instagram branch, I have to extract useful insights from the dataset provided. These insights will be derived based on the user engagements with Instagram such as likes across photos, trendy tags, number of posts, period of highest usage, etc. These in turn will help Meta grow its Instagram platform to engage more users, support marketing platforms on Instagram, improve its user experience and ultimately help the business grow. 

**Tech-Stack Used:**
To implement this project, I have used the MySQL Workbench community version 8.0.
